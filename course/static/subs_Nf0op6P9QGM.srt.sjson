    "coming up next on Fit for Duty we're in the weight room", 
    "on today's Fit for Duty we're focusing on", 
    "upper body core strength what you're going to need is just", 
    "one set of dumbbells and rubber resistance tubing", 
    "to your left hold it hold it hold it transitioning", 
    "upper body to core this is strength training awesome", 
    "and down", 
    "", 
    "welcome to Fit for Duty where Bolling Air Force Base here in Washington DC", 
    "and I'm accompanied by a senior airman", 
    "Ramos and Staff Sergeant Edgecomb of the Air Force Honor Guard We got the work out for you", 
    "operation pushing for power You guys ready to get started", 
    "awesome that they're gonna go ahead and get in sort of like a relax ready", 
    "position", 
    "for what I call push-up improvement plan one", 
    "now before they get started the whole strategy to this", 
    "is to use tricep strength and then move to chest strength they're going", 
    "to treat this just like it is the", 
    "Air Force fitness assessment or the Air Force fitness test", 
    "now if you get a fitness test this is the workout plan for you they're gonna", 
    "start in a close grip with their", 
    "thumbs touching or close to each close to each other", 
    "now go ahead and get in the ready position legs and back forming a", 
    "straight line", 
    "once they start there's no stopping", 
    "until it's over  ready  begin!", 
    "alright so they're knocking out push ups they're trying to keep their back and legs forming a straight", 
    "line they're gonna go", 
    "as far as they can go  with", 
    "this particular hand grip and they're not gonna shift", 
    "hand grips whatsoever until they reach", 
    "muscle fatigue or what we call muscle", 
    "failure only then would they actually make a transition", 
    "and move to an outside grip this", 
    "is very important so that you can use all that fast twitch", 
    "energy that you have associated with your triceps strength", 
    "when you have a close grip you've got triceps strength", 
    "now now let's look at over here at Staff Sergent Edgecombe right now he got himself", 
    "to an authorized rest position", 
    "without going to his knees raise his rear end in the air", 
    "and then move and slid his hands never lifting them off the ground and got", 
    "to a normal grip this is awesome he's moving out of triceps strength", 
    "and moving more to chest strength pectorals", 
    "right yeah he's getting smoked this is good now he told me he already worked out a", 
    "little bit in this area of his body yesterday so this is really gonna make", 
    "himself", 
    "out real good workout now he's already in a", 
    "wide grip and we've got senior Airman Ramos", 
    "he's got himself now going to a wide grip notice they", 
    "didn't drop to their knees yet at all the reason why this is called operation", 
    "pushing for power is they're doing just that to go to muscle", 
    "failure is the way the body will learn to get stronger", 
    "they're gonna take a break from the upper body tomorrow", 
    "and then come back to the style of training the next day", 
    "and that recovery period and then go and exploiting those muscle groups again", 
    "the following day is what's going to make them stronger", 
    "now pushing them here I'm treating it like it's sort of a diagnostic version", 
    "of their Air Force fitness test as you're doing a great job they're going", 
    "to muscle failure they're coming close and you're gonna see muscle failure soon", 
    "is when they were actually trying to do a pushup and their legs", 
    "will start to shake profusely this is where you wanna push yourself", 
    "even though it's just a standard workout yeah", 
    "we just started this is the first exercise and they're already", 
    "blowing out their upper bodies and their cores", 
    "people don't even realize this", 
    "when you're in the push-up position you're working your core muscles guys", 
    "you've got ten more seconds you are doing just great", 
    "I don't wanna see a break position again for the next ten seconds", 
    "let's go  stay there stay there good let's go let's go keep pushing keep", 
    "pushing if you can  go to muscle failure if you can", 
    "five!   four!   three!", 
    "two!  one!  relax! remember what makes this a superset", 
    "is they're not going to take much break", 
    "in between exercises we're looking at you know a chance", 
    "to kind of sip some water and if the break is more than 60 seconds", 
    "in between exercises that's too long", 
    "lets go ahead and pick up the short piece of tubing because we want to finish off our triceps now if you haven't got a tubing", 
    "uh set that's kinda shaped like a figure eight", 
    "or like a loop you gotta go ahead and take a long", 
    "piece and fold it in half", 
    "I prefer that we go ahead and go with something that's already designed for this", 
    "they're going to get in a start position for what is called an arm extension", 
    "then elbow elbows at the same height as the shoulders then you're going to follow my command from here on out so you can just concentrate on form go and finish together", 
    "ready  out  and in  cool", 
    "and out   and in", 
    "very good and out and in  make certain you're breathing", 
    "out  and in",

    "we are super setting here  don't take much of a break", 
    "go ahead and grab the dumbbells  next exercise is called", 
    "the Dumbell \"T\" push-up", 
    "and you're going", 
    "to drop down in that same push-up position they're in (if they have anything left in their push-up strength this is where we get rid of it right now)", 
    "alright push-up position  move!",

    "there  right there  try to get five more repetitions and we", 
    "encourage you to do the same now", 
    "once you reach your last repetition", 
    "in your goal of reaching 10 repetitions go ahead", 
    "stop shake it off get hydrated",

    "following serious sports injuries or after orthopedic surgery", 
    "patients are usually referred to a physical therapist or athletic trainers start", 
    "their rehab", 
    "initially the goal of rehab is to control swelling and regain a functional range of", 
    "motion", 
    "welcome back", 
    "we're going to continue where we left off in operation pushing for power", 
    "and go immediately from those dumbbell side raises to tubing side raises go ahead guys and grab that", 
    "long piece of tubing", 
    "put it underneath your left foot", 
    "and see this tubing as an extra sleeve to protect it from getting snapped",

    "no actually let's do one more push-up routine  yeah I know you guys have a little bit left in you I call these push-up pulses", 
    "folks", 
    "in order to train our shoulder muscles to work with our chest muscles we're going", 
    "to start on the ground we're only gonna come up four to six inches", 
    "and we're going to go really fast this is a quick sprint drill to finish off that chest strength", 
    "ready   go!", 
    "yes", 
    "muscular endurance training at its best", 
    "most people when they do a push-up test for", 
    "any one of the services they wind-up not going low enough during", 
    "the push-up test it trains the body", 
    "to go low enough during the push-up push-up pulses", 
    "ten nine eight seven six", 
    "five four three two", 
    "relax!  awesome job guys awesome let's", 
    "pick up the dumbbells now (I believe your chests are done now) this is great", 
    "awesome job  alright  now with this one this is a dumbbell forward raise", 
    "you're gonna bring it so that their palms are facing their upper thighs", 
    "and then once their ready at the start position I'm going to follow", 
    "a slow command of going up", 
    "and down good and don't lean back up and down perfect and up",

    "and down transitioning from chest to shoulders", 
    "up and down two more",

    "and up and down awesome job guys", 
    "let's put the dumbbells down let's grab the small piece of tubing", 
    "and go right into an upright row an upright row",

    "get it in there spread to just", 
    "inside that shoulder with grip and ready",

    "and down three more", 
    "and up down great form guys and", 
    "exhale  breathe in  one more", 
    "exhale  breathe in  very good", 
    "now let's go ahead and put the tubing back guys now let's go ahead and", 
    "really cook the arms now", 
    "we're gonna go ahead and", 
    "grab both the dumbbells and the tubing", 
    "at the same time", 
    "first pick up the tubing tubing first put underneath your left foot  alright", 
    "now hop over there to where we could grab the dumbbells", 
    "as well now you probably have never done this before but if you have you know that this", 
    "really is a tough exercise", 
    "what they're gonna do is their first holding on to the tubing and the tubing is", 
    "closest to their thumbs", 
    "now they're grabbing the dumbbells at the same time", 
    "because just doing the dumbells alone or the tubing alone", 
    "may not be enough to really burn out the arms we're going to make certain their", 
    "elbows are right locked into the rib cage and this is a great place to be in a", 
    "start position for safety purposes alright now", 
    "their going to follow my command ready up and down", 
    "elbows locked in good  up and down", 
    "really looking good  up", 
    "and down", 
    "alright up and down  remember the breathing", 
    "exhale  breathe in", 
    "exhale  breathe in", 
    "exhale  breathe in", 
    "looking good  exhale  breathe in", 
    "two more  and exhale  breathe in", 
    "one more  exhale  breathe in", 
    "now I want you guys to go ahead and bend down and put the dumbbells right in front of you on the ground", 
    "but keep the tubing in your hands", 
    "stand back up left arm up right on down", 
    "when I say go you're going to do see-saw curls as fast as you can", 
    "without compromising your form keep those elbows locked in", 
    "ready", 
    "go  alright", 
    "so doing the tubing alone or doing the dumbells alone", 
    "probably would have been easy but to do them", 
    "in this order secession and putting both of those", 
    "pieces of equipment together whatcha have is", 
    "a perfect opportunity", 
    "to go to muscle fatigue you're gonna take it to about 30 seconds", 
    "you've got five seconds left and then we're going to repeat some of the exercises  five  four", 
    "three", 
    "two  one  relax   alright", 
    "let's put the tubing back  let's go ahead and put", 
    "the dumbbells back to the outsides so they're not in our way  pick up", 
    "the long piece of tubing now and let's go ahead and go right to the top to the side-raises", 
    "put it underneath your left foot you don't have to do as", 
    "many repetitions this time guys we're already on the cook-out  ready", 
    "up and down  good  up", 
    "and down  let's go a little faster  up", 
    "and down good up and down", 
    "awesome one more up and down", 
    "alright  put it down", 
    "alright I think we did enough on the push-ups we're skipping the push-up pulses", 
    "won't you agree   alright  let's grab the dumbbells and let's do those forward-raises again and", 
    "we're going to do five repetitions and then the upright-rows", 
    "look  good  alright  palms facing the body  ready", 
    "up and down  awesome  don't lean back", 
    "up and down  awesome", 
    "good up and down  three more", 
    "up down that's right", 
    "and up down one more for good luck", 
    "up and down  awesome job guys", 
    "let's put the dumbbells down and let's grab that small piece of tubing and do", 
    "the upright rows you all are doing a great job I'm sure your", 
    "upper bodies are going to appreciate this tomorrow heh heh heh heh", 
    "good alright so you get your feet ready", 
    "palms ready alright elbows up", 
    "and down up and down looking good and", 
    "exhale  breathe in  exhale", 
    "breathe in  two more  exhale", 
    "breathe in  one more  exhale", 
    "breathe in  good  let's go ahead and put the tubing down", 
    "alright  ready to cook out the arms and do it one more time let's grab the tubing", 
    "and then grab the dumbbells and finish", 
    "with our arms and do some bicep curls with", 
    "both pieces of equipment notice an operation pushing for power", 
    "we only use one set of dumbbells and some rubber resistance tubing", 
    "and our bodies  that's all you need to really cook the upper body to this", 
    "magnitude  alright  ready  up and down  good", 
    "up and down looking good up", 
    "and down look at the elbows locked at the ribcage  up", 
    "and down looking good and exhale", 
    "breathe in  exhale", 
    "breathe in  great form  up and down  up", 
    "and down give me three more  three", 
    "down  two  down", 
    "and one more  one  down  good", 
    "alright so we are going to carefully bend down put the dumbbells on the ground but we are going to keep the tubing in our hands", 
    "that's right shake it off a little bit and stand back up in that same ready position", 
    "lock those elbows in at the ribcage", 
    "good and now this is the burn-out remember the tubing alone and the dumbbells alone", 
    "on the bicep curls probably would have been easy but using all of it together in", 
    "secession that's what makes it hard left arm up", 
    "and remember don't let those elbows go like this", 
    "keep them locked in the ribcage  begin  alright", 
    "now  while they're doing the last exercise", 
    "we're going to encourage you to do that same thing meet your goal", 
    "that same goal for them is going to be 30 to 40 seconds", 
    "in this last burn-out without compromising our form going to total muscle fatigue that's operation pushing for power", 
    "now  once you reach your goal we're going to ask you to go ahead and say", 
    "put the tubing and put the dumbbells back in their place", 
    "clean the area off  stay hydrated  sip some water", 
    "and while they go ahead and finish their goal we're going to say  see you at the next break", 
    "Hi I'm captain Brianne Newman registered dietitian USAF", 
    "so you wanna live a healthier lifestyle right I've got five", 
    "things that I feel are important for good eating habits",
