Success in both professions demands physical performance optimization. The difference is that in order for a Soldier to optimize performance, he must possess the speed and mobility to get there, the strength and power to do the job and the endurance to complete the mission.&rdquo; <strong>From Building the Soldier Athlete Manual, US Army</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>WA recently interviewed Captain Olivia Eldridge, a US Army Physical Fitness instructor and this is what she had to say about mobility.</strong><br /><br /><strong>WA</strong>&mdash;Why is mobility so important? It seems that strength training isn&rsquo;t enough.<br /><br /><strong>CPT. E</strong>&mdash;That&rsquo;s absolutely right. We need to develop the strength, coordination, and speed to get from a fighting position, to a sprint, and back to a fighting position in the most efficient means possible. We don&rsquo;t suddenly develop this ability when we&rsquo;re in a bad situation; we hone this skill while at home station. Mobility, like strength, is just a piece of the puzzle.<br /><br /><strong>WA</strong>&mdash;I&rsquo;ve tried to introduce mobility exercises into my routine, but the truth is, my mind wanders during long distance running and I get bored. What should I do?<br /><br /><strong>CPT. E</strong>&mdash;Well, first of all, you&rsquo;ve got it all wrong. You don&rsquo;t focus on long distance running for mobility. You should be concentrating on Anaerobic endurance events involve a period of high-intensity exercise balanced by periods of less intense exercise or rest. <br /><br /><strong>WA</strong>&mdash;Really?<br /><br /><strong>CPT. E</strong>&mdash;Sure. To build mobility you can do interval running, fast continuous runs, speed and agility drills, grass and guerrilla drills, individual movement techniques, combatives, and drills for negotiating obstacles. You should definitely look at the <a href="/static/Building_the_Soldier_Athlete_Manual_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">Building the Soldier Athlete Document</a>. It will help you design the right program for you&mdash;and don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;the short drills will keep your mind in the game!<br /><br /><strong>WA</strong>&mdash;Thanks, CPT Eldridge. I guess I have to go back to the drawing board&mdash;or shall I say, <a href="http://54.172.66.114:8080/unit/i4x://ADL/WA_101/vertical/144767aff0ae463aadcb986a42d22096#" target="[object Object]">PRT planning tool</a>. &ndash;end.<br /><br /><strong> Do you have any misconceptions about mobility?
