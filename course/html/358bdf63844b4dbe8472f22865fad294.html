<p>The FM 7-22 &ldquo;Army Physical Readiness Training&rdquo; is a product of our history, forged out of the great battles from the past to the present. Its doctrinal concepts also reflect emerging trends in current physical culture, and are important for the continuation of our national strength and security. The purpose of the FM 7-22 is not merely to make you look fit, but to actually make you physically ready for the conduct of full spectrum operations.<br />For the Ethos badge and the entire Warrior Athlete program, it is important for you to read Chapter 1 of the FM 7-22. The FM 7-22 provides comprehensive information about Army physical readiness training (PRT). Chapter 1 will introduce you to the basic philosophy and principles of Army PRT. Later in the Warrior Athlete program, you will read other chapters with detailed exercise instructions.</p>
